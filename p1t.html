<p>Performance and Portfolios.</p>
<p>We&acirc;&#8364;&#8482;re here to talk about
performance and portfolios. Our focus is on performance in the
classroom. We want to emphasize physical performances, what might be
called embodied learning. The hope is the performing offers an
alternative to class activities that constrain us. </p>
<p>
[00:30]
</p>
<p>
We need to think about
what it means to embody learning. For one, this embodiment opens
pathways
for transformation as it brings together our minds and our bodies. But
we want to extend these possibilities, to suggest that performance can
be
embodied in other ways, especially through learning portfolios. </p>
<p>
[01:02]
</p>
<p>
Much has
been published about the performative nature of writing. We want to
show
that portfolios can be similarly performative as they enact learning
stories. And performative portfolios can challenge constraints as they
embody new modes for collecting and representing knowledge. </p>
<p>
[01:30]
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We also want
to be clear about what's at stake. Performed portfolios don't just
offer
a pleasant means of integrating mind and body. Performance can capture
the stories of those who are excluded from institutional memory. And
performance can make known concerns that remain unheard in our
discussions of learning.
We can't just file away what we know. We need
to perform to bring to light what we don't know.
</p>
<p>
[02:00]
</p>
<p>
The recovery of missing
stories can be had when we extend performance to portfolios. And these
instantiations of learning can also participate in transformative
embodiment. Especially when created through activities like online
communal composing, new media meaning making, or other forms of digital
performance. </p>
<p>
[02:30]
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We get lots of stories about teaching. We're hearing one
right now. The stories correlate to the hierarchies we all know.
Portfolios pave the way for alternative stories, stories performed by
students rather than distilled by teachers. </p>
<p>
[02:50]
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We're all bound by the
familiar approaches. What we need are performances of learning. And
what
we need is to push the contention that unheard stories matter. Teachers
often look back and say, this is what I did in my class. It, too, is a
recovery move. A performance of learning. Portfolios extend the gesture
to students. These stories need to be heard. They count not only as
performed learning, but as enacted instances of embodied scholarship. </p>
<p>
[03:30]
</p>
<p>
In
that spirit, this is what we did in our class.</p>
