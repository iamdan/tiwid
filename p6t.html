The Job: Create a group web essay. Incorporate media. Present it to the
class.<br>
<br>
LITCEPTION<br>
<br>
Step 1: Assemble your team. <br>
<br>
List team members: Katie, Sarah, Sydney, Michela<br>
<p> [00:30] </p>
A picture of the group working together. Underneath: "Michela,&nbsp;
Sydney, Sarah, and I each did bring our own unique writing styles,
ideas, and opinions. However, rather than clashing, I feel that this
essay is a powerful collection of our different talents."--Katie.<br>
<br>
Screenshot of Google doc. Text onscreen: Online communication opened
the door to collaboration. Thank you, Google docs . . . all 8 of you.<br>
<br>
Zoom in on comments placed on each draft.<br>
<br>
Text: Writing became a process of feedback, comments, suggestions, and
revision.<br>
<p> [01:00] </p>
Step 2: Pick a topic.<br>
<br>
Screenshot of Google doc text, notes, and edits. Text on screen:
"Brainstorming yielded lots of ideas, one of which became the focus of
our first draft."<br>
<br>
Zoom in to underline, "Exploring the unconscious in films."<br>
<br>
Zoom in to highlight, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Inception</span>
(or another) is THE text - use this as a discussion for film and
literature."<br>
<p> [01:25] </p>
Step 3: Research and write.<br>
<br>
Back to video screen captures of Google docs. <br>
<br>
A text bubble: Initial Research Distribution: Sydney &amp;
Katie--Psychological elements of the film. Sarah--Possible literary and
cinematic influences. Michela--The making of the film &amp; director
background.<br>
<br>
Class website, cursor clicks on web essay draft. Text: FIRST DRAFT.<br>
<br>
Scroll through pages.<br>
<br>
Text bubble: Each one of our four original sections represented an
interesting aspect of <span style="font-style: italic;">Inception</span>,

but
the
essay lacked cohesiveness and a strong central idea.<br>
<p> [01:56] </p>
Step 4: Feedback.<br>
<br>
Highlight Dr. Anderson's thoughts and our responses.<br>
<br>
Text bubble: Heading towards a stronger thesis.<br>
<p> [02:20] </p>
Step 5: Presentation.<br>
<br>
The video introduction to the presentation, including clips from <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Inception</span>, plays.<br>
<br>
Text bubble: Part 1: Intro. Our presentation opened with a short
performance in which we viewed a "dream" on screen. It introduced our
audience to <span style="font-style: italic;">Inception</span> and the
exploration of illusion vs. reality.<br>
<br>
Screen opens on a Prezi presentation and zooms through slides.<br>
<p> [03:06] </p>
Text: Part 2: Prezi.<br>
<br>
Text bubble: "Prezi is not only simpler than PowerPoint, it looks
cooler and provides a new medium for a presentation."--Sarah.<br>
<p> [03:40] </p>
Step 6: Redirection.<br>
<br>
Screen shows a scan of our new outline.<br>
<br>
Text bubble: Building on performance feedback, we decided to go in a
different direction entirely. Our new thesis idea: How do films,
specifically <span style="font-style: italic;">Inception</span>, act
as lucid dream-like experiences?<br>
<br>
The most difficult part of the experience was letting go of our
writing, for the sake of the larger thesis.<br>
<br>
Screenshot video of the new essay.<br>
<br>
Text bubbles: After adding a new introduction and deleting what
detracted from our central idea, this is our current project.
<p> [04:23] </p>
Last lesson from the group web essay: Together student authors create
and collaborate organically to produce sophisticated scholarship.<br>
<br>
On screen: Assemble your team. Pick a topic. Research and write.
Feedback. Presentation. Redirection.<br>
<br>
Collaborate. Compose. Create. <br>
