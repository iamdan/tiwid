<h4>Transcript</h4>
<p> [00:00] </p>
One of the first projects that we were assigned in our class was the
movie mash-up, in which we took two different movies or types of media
and overlaid them together to compose a new piece that was a
combination of the two.<br>
<br>
Upon being assigned this, I had just finished watching the movie <i
 style="">Boogie Nights</i>, and I thought that this would be one good
extreme for my mash-up because <i style="">Boogie Nights</i> is a very
adult-oriented movie with mature thematic elements.<br>
<p> [00:30] </p>
<p> [Clip plays] </p>
<p> [00:58] </p>
Now that I had one movie picked out for my mash-up I needed another
movie to mix it with, and since <i style="">Boogie Nights</i> is a
very adult-oriented movie I thought that a child-oriented movie might
create good contrasts, and immediately my mind jumped to Disney, but I
needed a Disney movie that paralleled the themes expressed in <i
 style="">Boogie Nights</i>, a story about someone who is trying to
become all that he can be, a hero protagonist . . . so then I thought
of <i style="">Hercules</i>, in which Hercules strives to become a god
like his father, Zeus.<br>
<p> [01:30] </p>
<p> [Clip plays] </p>
<p> [01:52] </p>
Now it was time to mix the two texts together. I took the sound from a <i
 style="">Boogie Nights</i> theatrical trailer and cut and pieced
together animated clips from the movie <i style="">Hercules</i>;
mechanically this entailed me ripping the sound file from the trailer
using the website zamzar.com and ripping the entire DVD of <i style="">Hercules</i>
to my computer via a program called NERO, which I used also to compose
my video.<br>
<p> [02:15] </p>
By the end of my first draft, I was pretty pleased with the outcome, I
felt that the lips and voices synched up nicely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also,
mixing
the
two pieces helped me think about the story that I was
telling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The narrative in the<i style="">
Boogie Nights </i>trailer had to be reflected in the animated clips I
chose from <i style="">Hercules </i>to give the piece a fluid,
realistic feel to it; choosing and editing clips to correlate to the
audio narrative helped me revise the message of the trailer and of the
film.<br>
<p> [02:45] </p>
At the end of my mash-up I decided to add my own touch of personal
flair. I made my own movie poster for my combined movie. I took a <i
 style="">Boogie Nights</i> poster, edited out the people in the star
and pieced in a picture of Hercules using the program Corel Paint Shop
Pro Photo, and I felt that this gave an even more realistic and
believable feel to my mash-up and really tied the two items together.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My personal tweak ended up strengthening the
mixing of the project.<br>
<p> [03:15] </p>
Upon submitting my first draft, the feedback I received mainly
pertained to tweaking and tightening in certain areas, so I took this
into consideration while revising and tried to match the sound up to
the moving lips a little bit better. But my main concern was with a 5
second pause of black screen that I had at the beginning.<br>
<br>
This pause was distracting so I thought about what I could add as a
filler for that black screen.<br>
<br>
I couldn&#8217;t think of any clips that I felt would fit well in that
position, so what I ended up doing was mimicking a typical movie
preview screen and altering it to say, &#8220;The following preview has been
deemed as a mash-up of two separate movies for an English project.&#8221; And
at the bottom I put our class&#8217; website.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again,
I
started
with a personal touch but the end result was a more cohesive
project.<br>
<p> [04:05] </p>
And here is the final draft of my mash-up.<br>
<p> [Mashup plays] </p>
<p> [05:50] </p>
All-in-all, by the end of my final draft I was very pleased with my
mash-up. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I realized that a mash-up needs
contrasts, but also similarities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Working
with these qualities helped me create a new composition, an ironic one
given the nature of the individual films. <br>
