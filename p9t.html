<h4>Transcript</h4>
<p> Reflections are great because they look backward and move forward
at
once. There is a kind of capturing in the thinking about the project,
as well as an extension in articulating that thinking through the
performance of a composition. </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>[Hannah Easley's "This is What I Did in My Portfolio" plays on
screen.]</p>
<p>
[00:40]
</p>
<p>This holds true for the genre of the this is what I did in my
class essay. Here, Hannah reflects on two of her projects in the
course, a mashup and a screeencast. And she composes the reflection as
a screen cast. </p>
<p>
[01:15]
</p>
<p>The reflection has familiar elements like explorations of literacies
and discussions of composing moves. But it also sings. </p>
<p>
[01:45]
</p>
<p>And it connects with a viewer. It plays. </p>
<p>It extends "this is what I did" to "this is what I felt. And it
offers a rhetorical awareness as it reflects on its own composed
nature. </p>
<p>
[02:17]
</p>
<p>I like little serendipity when I teach. Make that a lot. I like to
be surprised. I like the way that this reflection embraces that. It
zooms
out, thinking about the way that learning itself is an improvisation,
learning itself--a performance. </p>

rest of video fades out with music and on screen views of early
invention materials for this project.]</p>
