<span style="font-style: italic;">A look at improvisation, focusing on
a portfolio screencast by Sarah Brady.</span><br>
<h4>Transcript</h4>
<p>In the book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Group Genius</span>,
Keith Sawyer explores the collaborative dimensions of creativity. He
focuses especially on the performance aspect of improvisation, and the
ways they relate to innovation. Here you can see some improvisation
with this presentation. Putting together a demonstration of this is
what I did in my class involves a fair amount of collaborative
improvisation. </p>
<p> [00:34] </p>
<p> I'm looking around. I've collected a lot of materials. And here I'm
going to link to a screencast that has been put together by Sara Brady.
In Sarah's screencast, she also improvises as she reflects on the
creation of a screencast. </p>

<p> [Transition to "Final Portfolio Screencast," by Sarah Brady] </p>
<p> [Transcript of "Final Portfolio Screencast":] </p>
<p> When I thought back over the English 150 projects that we have
completed this semester and considered which one I wanted to do for my
portfolio performance, only one really stood out at me and that was the
screencast that we had just completed. Part of that might be because I
have worked with so many of the other projects so much that I'm a
little bit tired of working with them. But part of it is also because I
really like the Camtasia Studio software and I'm really looking forward
to playing with it again. And also I kind of like the idea of doing a
screencsast about a screencast since this class is about postmodernist
fiction and it is like a self-referential, meta idea. So, I hope you
enjoy my screencast of a screencast. </p>
<p> [01:43] </p>
<p>When I first downloaded and opened Camtasia Studio, the first thing
I did was play around with the software a little bit: "Testing. Is this
recording? Hello, hello." </p>
<p>And I wasn't even sure that I wanted to use voice narration because
I like the mashups that had been put up previously with just, you know,
like hints about what the theme might be about, that were kind of vague
and let you draw your own conclusions. But after doing a lot of my
screencast I realized that I kind of needed the voice narration even
though I felt like I was kind of shoving it in peoples' faces: "this is
what I mean, Elijah does have this little connection to Eli in the
Road." But my point was really unclear without the narration, so I
decided to go for it. </p>
<p> [02:30] </p>
<p>I added music to my screencast because I thought it added an eery
feel and I chose something without any words that would just kind of be
playing in the background. Radiohead's "Treefingers" worked pretty
well, so I put that in. </p>
<p>Then I had to start thinking about what I was going to be doing for
my images in the screencast. And the first couple of things were pretty
easy because I was jut talking about Eli as a character and Elijah the
profit as a character. So I typed out a few passages from the book. I
put up a picture of what I would figure Eli to look like, and then a
couple Biblical pictures of Elija the prophet. </p>
<p> [03:03] </p>
<p> So at first I had all pictures and then I decided that I wanted a
different form of media. So I chose to incorporate the screen version
of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Road</span>. So I went to
YouTube and I found a trailer for <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Road</span> and ripped it from YouTube using Zamzar, and imported it
into Camtasia and took out the audio. And I was just kind of lucky that
they happened to show Eli in the trailer because I don't know otherwise
how I would have gotten him. </p>
<p> [03:32] </p>
<p>And my screencast pretty much fell together from there. I'll admit
that I had a few technical issues, but once I figured out how to
incorporate images with my voiceover and my underlying music, I pretty
much had the feel of the screencast and could figure it out from there.
</p>
<p> [03:49] </p>
<p>However, that's not to say I didn't have problems of my own. Having
a cold was especially nonhelpful. [Sneezes] "I don't know what I'm
saying. Why are you recording in the wrong spot? Why do I say 'um' so
much? Oh shit. Um, the main point of the. . . . [phone rings] Ugh. I
don't understand this program at all. [Sneezes] Um, Eli is the first
person the man and the boy have sustained contact with. Huh. With whom
the man and the boy have sustained contact with. [Sneezes]
[Indecipherable] However, that's not. . . . Oh, don't listen to me." </p>
<p>[Roommate:] "I'm not." </p>
<p> [04:30] </p>
<p>So I think all those bloopers pretty accurately sum up the
frustrations I have had and the fact that I'm putting them in shows the
sense of humor that I can have about my sometimes sketchy technological
skills and sometimes the frustrations that I've had with this project.
But I really think that over the course of the semester I've grown both
as a writer and as someone who used to be totally incompetent with
technology and now can put together a somewhat decent screencast. So I
hope that this project represents that and I hope you enjoyed watching.

<p>Improvised performances are clearly linked with creativity. And
Sarah's screencast shows how they are also linked with composing and
with learning </p>
