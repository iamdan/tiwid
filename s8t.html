<h4>Transcript</h4>
[00:00]<br>
<br>
[Audio: "Swing Life Away" by Rise Against]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;[All narration is delivered without voice through text boxes in
video]<br>
<br>
Some notes about process: &nbsp;<br>
<br>
[Screen picture of a time estimate window]<br>
<br>
1. It might take considerably longer on your wheezing four and a half
year old laptop. <br>
<br>
[00:23]<br>
<br>
["Camtasia Studio has encountered a problem" window shown]<br>
<br>
Camtasia in particular could crash at any time. So it is important to
save often. And also probably to not have too many browser windows
open. That is difficult for me. <br>
<br>
[00:36]<br>
<br>
[Video of the word "Repetition" being typed, audio of "Swing Life Away"
is made to sound like it is skipping a few times, and "Repetition" is
typed in synch to the skipping]<br>
<br>
2. Repetition is key. <br>
<br>
I spent a lot of time watching clips over and over, trimming the video
to fit the sound. <br>
<br>
[00:50]<br>
<br>
[Video of a Camtasia Studio project featuring Google Earth images]<br>
<br>
[01:00]<br>
<br>
[Screen&nbsp; picture of the "Camtasia Studio has encountered a
problem" window and a black screen over the Camtasia preview window]<br>
<br>
(This black square that is right now covering the video recorder is
unexpected.)<br>
<br>
(Patience is an important part of process.)<br>
<br>
[01:07]<br>
<br>
[Audio: The Notebook narration, "They met the night of the carnival.
They had nothing in common but after seeing Allie that night, something
inside Noah snapped." Screen is all black.] <br>
<br>
I don't know why this black screen is covering the Camtasia recorder. I
think I will restart my computer. <br>
<br>
[01:19]<br>
<br>
[Video: Black and white image from <span style="font-style: italic;">Night
of
the
Living Dead</span>]<br>
<br>
That fixed it. <br>
<br>
[01:22]<br>
<br>
[Video: <span style="font-style: italic;">Night of the Living Dead</span>
male character gesturing and female
character recoiling while audio of Noah and Allie in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Notebook</span>
repeats. "Will you go out with me?" "No!"]<br>
<br>
[01:34] <br>
<br>
I found editing to be very absorbing. I also found there is more
screaming than you would expect in the trailer for <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Notebook</span>.<br>
<br>
I found editing to be very absorbing. <br>
<br>
[01:39]<br>
<br>
[Video: screen recording of dictionary.com search for the term,
"meta"--self-referential; referring to itself or its characteristics,
esp. as a
parody]<br>
<br>
[01:55]<br>
<br>
[Screen recording of an urban dictionary search for the term, "meta"--a
term, especially in art, used to characterize something that is
characteristically self-referential.]<br>
<br>
This screencast is not what I expected it to be. <br>
<br>
[02:07]<br>
<br>
[Video: Camtasia editing window of sound waves, Hannah clicking
around.] <br>
<br>
I guess adaptability is a big part of my process. <br>
<br>
I intended to talk about a kind of obsessiveness in composing. But
instead, this is about the messiness behind the scenes. <br>
<br>
[02:26]<br>
<br>
[Video:&nbsp; "Camtasia Studio has encountered a problem" window]<br>
<br>
Which is okay too. <br>
<br>
[02:30]<br>
<br>
[Audio: "Swing Life Away" ends, screen fades to black.] <br>
