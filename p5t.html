<h4>Transcript</h4>
<p> [00:00] </p>
Collaboration was a major aspect of our Introduction to Literary
Analysis Class.<br>
<br>
Our class used an online space where we could share and develop our
work.<br>
<br>
We held conversations.<br>
<br>
We posted ideas.<br>
<br>
We responded to readings<br>
<br>
And we also were able to rate classmates work on a 5 Star scale.<br>
<p> [00:30] </p>
Because we got continual feedback, we never really worked alone.<br>
<br>
We helped each other pick and refine topics.<br>
<p> [01:05] </p>
All of this online interaction and the insights it generated was very
helpful&#8211;especially for those too shy to talk in class.<br>
<br>
We posted our projects straight to the website. Classmates could review
one anothers&#8217; work and offer feedback&#8211;constructive feedback, of course.<br>
<p> [02:05] </p>
We even posted our emerging class portfolios on the website. We were
able to get feedback on our projects from our professor and peers as we
worked on them throughout the class.<br>
<p> [02:30] </p>
One of our most collaborative projects was our PIT submission essay.
The class broke into groups of 4-5 people and constructed an essay on a
topic of their choice, having to incorporate media into it in some
fashion.<br>
<br>
The groups then had to demonstrate the topic by conducting a
presentation to be performed in front of the class.<br>
<p> [03:28] </p>
Even our portfolios developed through collaboration. We all posted our
work in progress, shared our reflections, offered feedback, and
celebrated one another&#8217;s creativity.
