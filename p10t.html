<p>Casting Learning into Flowing Streams.</p>
<p>We perform when we compose. And these performances reveal
boundaries, leading edges and liminal spaces.</p>
<p> [00:17] </p>
<p>[Transition to "[revision]," by Sean Mattio.]</p>
<p>[The next segments weave excerpts from student projects with
segments of narration:]</p>
<p>[Excerpt from "[revision]," by Sean Mattio: So my initial attempts
at brainstorming for the Web essay, seemed to be going nowhere."]</p>
<p> [00:30]<br>
</p>
<p>[Narration: Sean worked at the edges of print on his Web essay. But
his screencast embodies performance through sight, sound. . . .]</p>
<p>[Excerpt from "[revision]": Although admittedly I'd never done a Web
essay before and wasn't entirely sure what it was outside of what it
sounded like, an essay on the Web. But it seems not only did I not know
. . . Google didn't have very many ideas either. Behold, the Web
essay.] </p>

<p>We're pushing modes that perform with image, sound, and motion.
Essays happen in this space as well, and they make compelling claims.</p>
<p> [01:18] </p>
<p>[Transition to "The War Goes On: Watchmen, Vietnam, and America's
National Identity Crisis," by Katie Meyer.]</p>
<p>[Excerpt from "The War Goes On: Watchmen, Vietnam, and America's
National Identity Crisis": In the Watchmen universe the US victory in
Vietnam does significantly alter the course of history. However, some
very important things do no change: there is still disunity and rioting
in the streets. People still distrust their leaders. There is still
divisive partisan politics. Rather than ending the cold war, victory in
Vietnam only intensifies the conflict. And the inevitable threat of
nuclear holocaust persists throughout the entire novel. Maybe Moore and
Gibbons are suggesting that the Vietnam war wasn't traumatizing because
we lost, but because of the way that we fought. We were confronted with
facts that contradicted the way we wanted to see ourselves. Superman
wouldn't drop napalm on villagers. The Vietnam war, like the novel
Watchmen, forces us to ask, Who are the superheroes, and who are the
villains] </p>

<p>We aren't just saying we can put ourselves into digital as well as
written compositions. We say these modes offer new repertoires for
telling stories.</p>

<p>We know performance and composition are linked through the writing
process, that we perform when drafting or revising. But often this
performance links us together. We give feedback. We rethink and
recreate. We listen and respond, then we offer our own performative
acts hoping to connect with others.</p>

<p>We know that, through language, performance controls us, binds our
identities and shapes our thinking about the world. But we can also
recognize how performance pushes boundaries, liberates us from
constraints and connects us with others.</p>
<p> [04:33] </p>
<p>[Transition to "I am a. . . .," by Sydney Stegall]</p>
<p>[Narration continues during "I am a. . . .,"]</p>
<p>We believe improvisational learning is in tune with the liberatory
mode of performance.</p>
<p>We believe learning offers a lens for performance. And that
portfolios focus the lens, casting new knowledge through reflection.</p>
<p> [04:52] </p>
<p>We offer new media composing as a model that embodies performance.
And that brings us together. We say yes to writing. And to image,
sound, and motion.</p>
<p>We want new registers of meaning, the fluid currents of creativity.
We want to feel the currents and hear all the voices. This is what we
did in our class.</p>
